# Snip & Ship

## What is it?

It is a structured collection of tagged notes about machine learning theory and practice (now, in Russian only). Each note is independent of the others, but some of them require familiarity with core concepts and definitions.

Two key parts of the repository are as follows:
* The notes itself, all of them are written specially for this project;
* Search system.

Currently, there are a small number of notes and so there is no need in complicated search system. However, an outline of its evolution is created. Planned features of the search system are as follows:
- [x] Search by single tag
- [x] Logical operators
- [ ] Support of tags hierarchy
- [ ] Full-text search
- [ ] Ranking based on flexible parameters

## How to use it?

There are two main ways to browse notes efficiently.

#### Online

Website will be launched soon. All necessary instructions will be provided there.

#### Offline

As always, this repository can be cloned to your local machine. Just run `git clone https://github.com/Nikolay-Lysenko/snip_and_ship` from your terminal.

When the repository is cloned, open the file named `counts_of_tags.tsv`. It contains tags and their frequencies in tab-separated format. Look through the file and choose the tags you are interested in. Suppose that they are 'tag1', 'tag2', and 'tag3'. To make a notebook with notes that are associated with at least one of these tags, run:

```
python offline_tools/search.py -e tag1 OR tag2 OR tag3
```

More complex filtering is supported too. You can write arbitrary logical expressions with AND and OR operators and parentheses:
```
python offline_tools/search.py -e \(tag1 OR tag2\) AND \(tag3 OR tag4\)
```
Do not forget to escape parentheses, because without escaping `bash` fails.

After your query is run, look at the freshly created file named `notes_for_the_last_query.ipynb`. Enjoy reading!

## How to contribute?

Everyone can create a pull request.

Note that it is strongly recommended to update counts of tags and Markdown files for website automatically. This is easy â€” just copy and rename files from `hooks` directory according to instructions that are placed inside of them right below shebang. If it is done correctly, Git hooks will refresh tag statistics and other necessary files for you.

When working on a pull request, keep in mind internal structure of the project. It is assumed that there are three types of files:
* Notes written by humans. All of them must be inside `notes` directory in `ipynb` format;
* Automatically created files. They never should be updated manually;
* Infrastructure code. It can be stored inside these directories:
    - `hooks` (Git hooks),
    - `readingblocks` (web version),
    - `offline_tools` (offline version).
